## INSTALLATION:
Download Noesis from here: https://www.richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php&showproject=91
Once it is installed, navigate to your [Noesis Installation Path]/plugins/python folder and put fmt_RE_MESH.py in there, and re-launch the program.
Opening a mesh or tex file with Noesis will automatically load it, once the plugin is installed. 


## NOESIS MAXSCRIPT:
To use the optional Noesis Maxscript (REEM Noesis CMD), you should edit the included .ms file to tell it where your Noesis.exe is. 
Then you can run the maxscript in 3dsMax with Scripts -> Run Script, and use it to remote-control Noesis as to seamlessly import and export with a GUI inside 3dsmax.


### Tips
- The plugin supports opening RE Engine SCN files. These files can contain a list of meshes at certain positions, constituting a stage or map
- The plugin saves the location of your extracted re_chunk_000.pak folder ("Base Directory") for each game in a txt file next to the plugin. Edit this file if it is not correct
- In the mesh/animation import window, double click ".." to go up a parent directory, or paste in a directory into the text box to go there
- You can load multiple meshes together in addition to the mesh you first selected. They and their bones will be merged together into the same model
- When loading a mesh, click the "Select Animation" button to load motlist animations with it, useful for quickly testing rigging
- You can export an animation with the Noesis `-fbxmultitake` advanced option to separate the animations onto different tracks. Then find the Blender FBX import plugin, open the `io_scene_fbx` folder, locate the `import_fbx.py` find the `# Compute framerate settings section`, change its 25fps to 1, and save. Then change the frame rate from 1 to 60 after importing to Blender
